Selim Jahan introduces the idea that for far too long the paradigm of economic development has dominated the idea of human development. Jahan states that while income is critical it is not an end, and that human development is about expanding the richness of life, not the richness of the economy within which human beings live. What are some of the targetted issues that Jahan examples as requiring focus throughout the world? Elaborate further on Jahan’s definition of human development. What are the different measures incorporated into the Human Development Index that serve to capture the breadth and focus of each countries’ average achievement?

Hans Rosling states that “we underestimate the tremendous social change that often precedes economic change” and proceeds to provide several examples. What were some of the examples Rosling presented where health appeared to be a precursor to wealth? What was Rosling’s warning regarding the dangers of using averages when describing development?


Jahan defines human development as the enhancement of the power of choice making, saying that there are two sides to human development.  Firstly, the capabilities of human beings have to be enhanced, and second, the opportunities to use those capabilities have to be improved.  However, human development should not be focused on economic growth, rather human development is of the people, for the people, and by the people.  Jahan claims that the focus measure of human development is the Human Development Index, which captures the basic attributes of human development.  These attributes include a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living.  The idea of these focus measures of human development is to concentrate on these key areas, which would open doors for more choices, bettering human development.
One example provided by Rosling where health preceded wealth is in the case of the United Arab Emirates.  The UAE was a relatively wealthy country, however they had shorter life spans and higher births than many developed countries.  Because of this, the UAE decided to focus on the health of their citizens, and despite falling oil prices, still improved their wealth.  Rosling’s warning about the dangers of averages had to do with not properly reflecting on country’s development, because of the vastly different populations within a country.  For example, the wealthiest 20% of the population of South Africa are vastly more healthy than the poorest 20%, yet we still promote solutions that fail to account for the socioeconomic differences in the African populations.  This issue is most exemplified by people referring to solutions to human development in “Africa,” however each African country and the people within each country are vastly different, meaning that solutions need to be contextualized in order to provide meaningful aid.
