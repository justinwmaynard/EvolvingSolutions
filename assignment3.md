### Use of a Bayesian belief network and gravity model for improved prediction of migration in relation to climate change throughout Africa

by Justin Maynard April 19, 2020



### Introduction

Human migration resulting from climate change has varying degrees of impacts on human development. Data science methods can be used to model migration as related to climate change, allowing for specific solutions to this human development issue. There are three types of migration as influenced by climate change, environmental emergency migrants, environmentally forced migrants, and environmentally motivated migrants. [2] Environmentally emergency migrants are forced to relocate due to a sudden environmental emergency, environmentally forced migrants are forced to move due to long change climatic influences, while environmentally motivated migrants choose to move because environmental conditions make their situation unfavorable. Environmental emergency and forced types of migrations are involuntary, as they have no choice but to move, leading to a larger impact on human development.  The relation to human development is apparent when looking at Amartya Sen’s idea of expansion of freedoms.  When involuntarily migrating, migrants are unable to be part of a labor force, removing a key component to economic freedom. Generally, voluntary migrants are able to preserve their ability to be included in the labor force, meaning there is less of an impact on economic freedoms.  However, both voluntary and involuntary migrants experience a loss of social freedoms, as migrants are uprooted from communities and social bonds.  Through geospatial data science methods such as gravity models and bayesian belief networks, the impact of climate change on migration can be studied.



### **Inquiry Type**

  The central research question pertaining to the effect of climate change on migration is an explanatory inquiry, as the question seeks to explain what is happening in a situation or problem. In this case, the research seeks to explain how climate change influenced migration by identifying why migration takes place, where it occurs, and the processes behind migration.  Breaking the research question down into three more possible sub-research questions is possible. The first being is migration destination influenced by climatic variables?  Next, one could research what type of climatic variables are most influential on migration patterns?  Lastly, which variables influence migration duration?  In relation to human development, the research seeks to explain migration processes, allowing for researchers to identify areas where human development issues are arising.



### **Geospatial Methods - Introduction - BBN**

  To explain the process of human migration in relation to climate change, a gravity model and a Bayesian belief network was used. In Drees and Liehr, a Bayesian belief network (BBN) is used to analyse social ecological conditions in the Sahel. [1]  A BBN was selected because it is an integrated modelling method, and has a “broad applicability due to its high flexibility in the terms of the underlying data.” A BBN is able to portray a large number of different factors and their relations, allowing for the study of causal relationships with climate change and human migration.  This particular research developed two models simultaneously to study two areas.  Drees and Liehr first mapped migration motives in Linguère, Senegal and Bandiagara, Mali to determine the reasons for migration, and to see if climate change had an impact. They also created a scenario axis to determine if the destination, duration, and motives of migration changed in different scenarios.  To cover the environmental influences of migration as well as the societal aspects, they link social-ecological systems (SES) with the concept of ecosystem services (ESS). [1]  The main component of the migration system is a “natural sphere of the SES” formed by ecosystem functions that “provide ESS to the societal actors.” [1] Thus, migration can be seen as a “practice to secure the family’s livelihood,” which is influenced by SES and ESS systems. 

  The BBN used is promising for the task, as when working with conditional probabilities, the BBN can explicitly handle uncertainty that occurs in complex systems. [1] By gathering information “about an event B the initial” the “prior probability of an event A is updated,” giving the “posterior probability of event A.”  In addition to the conditional probabilities, a qualitative component is created. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the “dependencies between the variables (nodes)” is created with arrows pointing from given conditions (parent nodes) to likely effects (child nodes).” [1]  This is key in studying the relations within the system and SES.

  

### **Geospatial Methods - Introduction - Gravity Model**

  An alternative to a Baysian belief network, a gravity model, is used by Mastrorillo et al. to evaluate the influence of climate variability on internal migration flows in South Africa.[2] South Africa is a highly relevant case to study, as South Africa has high internal migration rates, consisting of about 5% of the population. [3]  Like many other African countries, South Africa is experiencing significant effects from climate change, with an increase of .13 degrees Celsius per decade.[3] South Africa, as a result of aparteid rule, experiences persistent poverty and racial inequality leaving these groups more vulnerable to climate change.  Lastly, agriculture is still relevant, as climate variability impact on migration could impact South Africans indirectly or directly “via the agricultural channel.”[3] An augment gravity model is used to observe the patterns and determinants of the South African “interdistrict bilateral migration flows” from 1997-2001 and 2007-2011. Determinants such as geographic, socio-economic, and demographic determinants are used, and covariates are introduced to control for the “spatiotemporal distribution of climatic factors.”[3] Migration data was collected from South Africa’s 1996, 2001, and 2011 censuses, and the 2007 community survey (CS).  This census and CS data covers a wide range of information, including demographics, health and fertility, education and employment, morality, housing, households and services, and migration.  While data is available on current and past residences, the resolution of the data varies. This led the researchers to use the 2001 and 2011 census as to be able to track from origin to destination at the district council level.  They defined migrants as people who moved between two different district councils within the five years leading up to the 2001 and 2011 census.  The five year interval was chosen to the 1996 census and 2007 CS could be used to build a “set of demographic and socio-economic variables” to be used as lagged covariates in their regression exercise. [3] Climatic data was taken from the African Drought and Flood Monitor project, which monitors hydrological conditions of land surfaces in Africa through the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. [3]  This model provides data on climatic indicators such as precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture, used as a proxy for climate change.



### **Geospatial Methods - Data - BBN**

  Drees and Liehr first step in preparing data for the BBN was to classify the variable categories. [1] Social variables classification were determined by the survey, while the environmental variables needed further defining. The socio-empirical survey data covered 905 interviewees, 460 in Senegal, and 445 in Mali.  The dataset was then reduced to 337 cases in Linguère, Senegal, and Bandiagara, Mali, as interviewees in the capital cities of Dakar and Bamako had already left their place of origin, which would distort the rate of migration.[1] To account for an absence of data on income, the “economic situation” was classified based on data on possession of different goods and access to domestic infrastructure. [1]  Environmental variables were classified with the K-means algorithm, and in the case of Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) and “precipitation anomalies,” values were represented by a deviation of the mean. Migration motives were also based on the survey, and grouped by contextually.   The data for environmental conditions was formed by datasets provided by the Research Group of Climatology from the University of Bayreuth.  Lastly, environmental data was assigned to individuals survey data to allow for the effects of climate change on migration to be studied.

In the BBN structure, “mutually interacting social-ecological conditions” determine the different motives for migration, which “were identified in relation to the characteristics of spatial and temporal migration patterns.” This was done by aggregating different answers from survey questions on reasons for migration that relate to comparable motivations.  The crucial migration motives identified are “education,” “familial,” sustenance/employment,” and “visit/curiosity.” The motives “education,” “familial,” and “visit/curiosity” are influenced by societal conditions, while “sustenance/employment” is a child node of environmental and social variables. [1]  For further development of the model, submodels based on the four models for migration were developed. The submodel for the motives “education,” “familial,” and “visit/curiosity” included all socio-economic variables, while “sustenance/employment” was split into two submodels, including socio-economic and environmental variables. [1]  Once the number of parent nodes is reduced to five, the two models are merged. To reduce parent nodes, first the BBN of each submodel is trained with the complete dataset using the expectation maximisation algorithm.  The sensitivity of each child node, representing the migration motive, to findings of the parent node is completed, allowing for the least influential node to be excluded.  While the number of influencing variables is reduced to five, the combination of variables with “the best predictive accuracy of the migration motive” is determined with a train and test method. The model is trained with a randomly selected 85% of the dataset, while the remaining 15% test the models performance in predicting the migration motive. [1]  In the final step, “the interrelations between social and environmental variables are identified according to expert judgements, contextual logic and correlative links.”  This allows for the researchers to study the relationships between climate change and migration, and to visualize the most important variables that contribute to migration.  Shown below is the BBN trained for Linguère and Bandiagara, respectively.

  Another use of the BBN in addition to mapping migration motives was to “estimate altering future developments in different scenarios,” with an ultimate goal of policy recommendation. [1] Two axis were used, the first being “politics and economy” describing political stability and economic development.  The second axis was “climate,” describing low versus severe regional impact of climate change. Four scenarios, “limitation,” “crisis,” “prosperity,” and “stagnation” were analyzed, with regards to consequences in the economy, agriculture, politics, demography, life quality, and the environment.  Shown below is the structure of the scenario axis.

  The BBN can also be used as an analytical and diagnostic tool. This was achieved selecting a single or combination of characteristics of nodes to generate the “posterior probabilities of the dependent nodes.” [1] This serves as a method to identify migration patterns of selected groups of people, and get an systematic overview of factors contributing to migration.[1] 



### Geospatial Methods - Data - Gravity Model

To evaluate the determinants of inter-district migration flows with a gravity model, Mastrorillo et al. first estimates the “Poisson Pseudo Maximum-Likelihood (PPML) with errors clustered at the dyadic level (ij):” [3]

![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vwUvvzzN7JbWizlDD89TtbIPq-gkQLenwcOXxRgai4pm3VGHfc1xzm84dqGQMhkA1J7T3uJm5xfUiXriFwj3AVGDtNtt8Pj-qo3DIvI3URcTSqt3Ivd2rL6C-FOf6PpBaKUSAhTr)In this framework, i and j are the origin and destination district councils, t is the census years, mij*,*t represents five year individual migration from i to j. [2] K is a constant, ɛt/ij is “an error term with mean equal to 1;” *ψi* are “origin fixed effects;” Φj,t  is “time-destination fixed effects;” Z*ij* is a “log of geographic distance between i and j;” X*i*,*τ*(*t*) is a “vector of lagged demographic and socio-economic” controls at years 1996 and 2007; and C*i*,*ω*(*t*) is a “vector of origin climatic variables” computed over five year intervals. [3] For the climatic vector, C*i*,*ω*(*t*), positive anomalies of five year averages of the maximum temperature are used, and to calculate precipitation extremes, positive and negative anomalies of five year averages are used. [3] Also included in the climatic vector is a measure of soil moisture.  The average of relative soil moisture from the five years preceding a census was used.  To account for the geography of migration flows as shown in vector Z*ij* , the distance between origin and destination as well as the geographical contiguity between districts is calculated. [3] The last step was controlling for “a number of lagged demographic and socio-economic factors” likely to have an influence on migration flows, represented by X*i*,*τ*(*t*). The size effects at origin were controlled using total district population to account for highly populated districts possessing larger out migration flows. Another variable was included to account for the differing effects of migration on different ethnicities.  Also included in the socio-economic factors was the tendency to migrate towards places offering better labor opportunities, as well as a control for educational attainment.



### Findings - BBN

  When examining the findings of the BBN used by Drees and Liehr to analyze social-ecological conditions for migration in the Sahel, it can be seen that the BBN was successful in plotting scenarios and motives of migration in the Sahel. To determine the reasons for migration in different scenarios, the variables “education,” “economy,” “precipitation,” and “land cover” are changed. [1]  This chart below shows the changes in variables during each scenario.  These scenarios are then processed by the BBN to determine migration motives in each situation. 



| **Variables**     | **Limitation**    | **Crisis** | **Prosperity** | **Stagnation** |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Education**     | Positive          | Unchanged  | Positive       | Unchanged      |
| **Economy**       | Slightly positive | Negative   | Positive       | Unchanged      |
| **Precipitation** | Negative          | Negative   | Unchanged      | Unchanged      |
| **Land Cover**    | Slightly positive | Negative   | Positive       | Unchanged      |



As shown by the two graphics below, there is a stronger influence from the horizontal “politics and economy” axis than shown on the vertical “climate” axis. [1]

  The above graphics show the influence of migration motives, duration, and destinations when presented with different scenarios, and the darker gray colors represent a larger impact. When comparing the findings between Bandiagara and Linguère, it can be seen that many of the results are similar, except that the “ethnicity” and “precipitation variation” nodes do not appear in both. The ethnicity node was found to be one of the most important for Linguère, and when the “familial” and “visit/curiosity” nodes in Bandiaga are used as a proxy for ethnicity, it can be seen that ethnicity is also important in determining migration in Bandiagara. [1] Even with these differences, the studies “showed more similarities than differences.” [1]  Both studies show evidence of the linkage between “economic conditions and duration of migration,” as non-permanent migrations were common (84.9% in Bandiagara and 76.9% in Linguère), and improved economic situations lead to more permanent migrations. This fact shows the impact of migration on human development.  Temporary migrations are undesirable, due to their impact on quality of living, and when economic conditions allow for it, migrants would rather permanently migrate to improve their quality of life.  This phenomenon in part can be explained by the desire for education, which is not found in small and remote villages, and a permanent or long term migration is often necessary to complete education. [1] Overall, these findings showed that climate impact, while important, carries less weight than economic and political conditions. 

  When looking at the influence of environmental conditions and socio-economic conditions on migration in the Sahel, the most important factors in the BBN are “gender,” “economic situation,” and “marital status” in Bandiagara, and “ethnicity,” “family’s economic activity,” and “age at migration” in Linguère. Drees and Liehr observed that the observed low sensitivity to environmental and climatic factors is not explained by their low “de facto significance,” or methodological failures.  Instead, this is explained by the structure of the BBN itself, which specified environmental nodes as parent nodes to only one migration motive, “sustenance/employment,” while socio-economic nodes are parents to all four migration motives. [1] Another issue that arose was that the socio-empirical survey data was often unable to identify interviewees’ place of birth, or migrations may have occurred during years not fully covered by data sources. [1]  Lastly, the researchers found it difficult to represent the environmental situation for individuals at the correct scale. 

To correct for inaccuracies, and to determine a mean error rate for the different migration motives, a quality assessment of the model was conducted. This assessment was conducted by generating five sets of training datasets with 85% of the dataset, and 5 sets of testing datasets using 15% of the dataset. [1] Once trained with the training dataset, the smaller testing dataset is used to “compute the likely outcome for previously selected variables,” which is then “compared to actual data entry.” By assessing the mean errors of different migration patterns and motives, the ability of the model to detect patterns can be assessed. [1]



### Findings - Gravity Model

The gravity model, as used by Mastrorillo et al. to study internal migration flows in South Africa, showed that geographical, economic, socio-demographic, and environmental factors all played varying degrees of influencing mobility across districts. The gravity models findings revealed that “temperature and precipitation anomalies” from the origin “exert asymmetric push effects” that increase out migration, and rainfall shortages and excess temperature have the strongest impacts.  Soil moisture also appears to be another causing factor in out migration. Mastrorillo et al. also found that the relative impact of climate variability has different impacts on different migrant groups, with black and low income South Africans being the most affected. [3]  When these groups are more vulnerable, they may be forced to use migration as an adaptation strategy.  The researchers identified that this raises the problem of those vulnerable to the impact of climate change, yet “cannot afford migration as an adaptation mechanism.” This is a prominent research gap, and threatening to human development standards, as there could be adverse effects like loss in income or employment if people are unable to migrate due to climate change.

### Discussion and Comparison

  When comparing studies completed on migration and relation to climate change, the main difference between a BBN and a gravity model is that a BBN is able to analyze and predict scenarios relating to migration, while a gravity model is able to determine factors relating to migration and analyze those factors. The BBN as used by Drees and Liehr was able to predict scenarios relating to migration and climate change in the Sahel, and individual nodes could be analyzed to determine the reasons for migration.  However, the BBN methodology was unable to properly analyze the impact of climate change on migration, as there were more parent nodes leading migration reasons not related to migration. On the other hand, the gravity model as used by Mastrorillo et al. was successful in determining push and pull factors for migration in South Africa.  The gravity model was able to break down migration into push and pull factors like race, employment, precipitation anomalies, soil moisture, and temperature anomalies.  By taking this data, and using GIS software, the researchers showed how a more detailed look at migration in specific areas can be seen. The BBN model is successful in answering the central research question by identifying relationships between climate change and migration through scenario processing, however the gravity model is better fitted.  This is because the gravity model has the ability to analyze specific areas for specific covariates, which has more application as relating to improving human development.  For example, one could map where push and pull factors such as climatic variables are present, and compare that to a map of actual migration, showing areas that would benefit from migration but are unable to do so. By providing more specialized results, the gravity model is more effective than a BBN.

One important research gap, that was also briefly recognized by Mastrorillo et al., is that there have been no studies of people who would benefit from migration, but do not have the means to do so. These people, or “intransient populations,” occur when people do not have the resources to use migration as an adaptation to sudden or gradual climatic disasters.  Because these people are unable to migrate, they are unable to better themselves in terms of human development, or their situation could be worsened. The gravity model as used by Mastrorillo et al. would be the most efficient way to determine and then study these populations.  Using the output from the gravity model, one could compare actual migration rates to areas with strong push factors, therefore identifying populations that were unable to move.  The gravity model also is able to identify specific characteristics of migrants, and that same principle could be applied to intransient populations, allowing for researchers to study why such populations are unable to migrate. The use of a gravity model to study intransient populations could help solve a major research gap.
