### 1. Unveiling hidden migration and mobility patterns in climate stressed regions: A longitudinal study of six million anonymous mobile phone users in Bangladesh

​	The most important idea presented in this article is the promising use of mobile network operator call detail records (CDR) as a supplementary data source used to monitor and respond to migration as a result of climate change. The article specifically looked at Bangladesh where Cyclone Mahasen struck in May 2013.  Bangladesh in specific is prone to climate change related weather, as their sea-level rise is occurring faster than global averages, which exposes 11 thousand square kilometers of land and 20.5 million people to greater risk by 2050. Bangladesh is also a suitable candidate for this study because of the increase in mobile phone ownership, with the proportion of households with at least one phone rising from 78% to 89% between 2011 and 2014.  The study succeeded in quantifying various elements of migratory episodes in Bangladesh using CDR, such as incidence, direction, duration, and seasonality. 

​	To achieve this quantifying of migratory episodes, two de-identified data sets from the largest mobile network operator in Bangladesh, Grameephone (GP), was used. The first data set (D1), covered April 30th to June 2013, which includes the period before and after the Cyclone Mahasen hit in May 2013.  The second dataset (D2) comprised of a simple random sample of one million mobile phones drawn from the entire national set of phones on the GP network. One use of the data was in measuring human mobility, in which mobility was assessed as a response to evacuation messages across a large area, allowing more contextualized responses.  Another use was in determining specific neighborhoods receiving migrants, which could be identified in order to steer intervention resources. Also found from comparing the data was two correlations: between incidence and duration of migratory episodes, and between in and out migration per district.  The result of comparing incidence and duration of migratory episodes is a strong linear correlation, in which an increase in the proportion of persons migrating increases the time migrants spend away from their district. The finding in the correlation between in and out migration is related to labor in which increasing out migration decreases opportunities in the area, which would negatively affect the probability that people from outside will migrate into the area, representing a negative relationship.  Overall, this CDR data and its relationships prove the viability of CDR in studying the effects of climate change in migration.

​	The significant harms being addressed in the article are migration and disaster management and response as a result of climate change. One harm comes in the form of decreased economic opportunities in affected areas, which is an un-freedom that prevents development according to Amartya Sen. When disasters affect areas, less people are likely to move into disaster affected areas, decreasing opportunities for work, which according to Sen decreases quality of life. Although there are many development problems arising from natural disasters, this focus on restrictions of markets sustainable development goal number eight and three, decent work and economic growth, and good health and well-being.
