## Theory Response

------

While the advent of big data is indeed shifting how we study across various disciplines, and while there is a paradigm shift occurring, the idea of theory is not completely dead. Anderson wrote in his 2008 article for Wired that big data makes the scientific method obsolete, because the need for analyzing the data has disappeared when computers and algorithms can more efficiently determine correlation without the need for causation. I don’t agree with Anderson’s idea that theory is dead.  Instead, I agree with Kitchen’s idea that while big data may advance scientific study into a new era, the same theories used in the scientific method should be used when studying data.  As brought up by Kitchen, data does not provide an end all solution, as the reasoning behind the data should still be studied to completely understand the correlations shown by the data. The reasoning that a fourth paradigm is being brought forth in the scientific method is because data adds another step in the scientific method.  Big data adds “data intensive, statistical exploration, and data mining,” which should be used in conjunction with the “simulation of complex phenomena” previously used in the age of computational science.
