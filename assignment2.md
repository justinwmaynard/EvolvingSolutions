### Use of classical and machine learning data science methods for improved prediction of migration in relation to climate change throughout Africa

​											by Justin Maynard April 5, 2020



### Introduction

​	Data science can be used to understand and measure climate change as a determinant of migration in Africa. Climate change has been known to impact human development in various fashions, and recently climate change’s effect on human migration has increasingly been recognized. Multiple African countries’ economies are fueled by agricultural and other natural resource productions. Accordingly, exposure to extreme weather and environmental degradation as a result of climate change has the ability to have adverse effects on the lives of millions of Africans.[4, 1] As a human development issue, migration is specifically relevant in Africa, as a large number of Africans are dependent on employment easily affected by climate change.  Many governments in Africa lack social institutions that relieve the effects of climate change.[5]  A response to the impact of climate change is migration. According to “Effects of Future Climate Change on Cross-Border Migration in North Africa and India,” “emmigration acts as a safety valve” that is used to alleviate pressure on resources and unemployment.[5] 

​	The purpose of this research is to analyze the impacts of climate change on migration by comparing classical statistical methods to machine learning models. The methods being analyzed are survey data and environmental data, which is a proxy for climate change.  It will analyze the extent of the relationship between climate change and differing types of migration in Africa.

1. Use remotely sensed environmental data combined with survey data to estimate the relationship between climate change and migration across Africa

2. Use machine learning methods to build a model to estimate the motives for migration

​	This work will build on previous research by Lukas Drees and Stefan Liehr, Marina Mastrorillo et al., and Murat Bayar and Mustafa Aral, and will incorporate new methods of inferring populations unable to migrate as well as advances to inferring human development effects on populations unable to migrate. [1, 4, 6,]



### Human Development Topic - Migration

  Migration is an essential part of life in many agriculturally dependent communities, as migration has the possibility to offer more income or opportunities for a family. To study the effects of climate change on migration, migration must first be defined.  There are numerous ways to define migration, and a comprehensive definition that addressed environmental determinants of migration was found in Lu et al.[10] According to Lu et al., migrants are defined as “individuals that leave their place of residence,” and move to a different district or municipality, region, district, or country.  Moreover, there are different reasons for migration, and different types of migrations that accompany these reasons. Lu et al. differentiated migration between environmental emergency migrants, environmentally forced migrants, and environmentally motivated migrants.  Environmental emergency migrants are people who flee because of natural disasters; environmentally forced migrants are people who leave because of slow-onset effects that destroy their basis of existence; and motivated migrants are people who have the ability to choose to leave their home because environmental conditions become unfavorable.  These reasons are consequential as each type of migrant suffers differing impacts relating to human development when they migrate. 

​	Reviewing other studies revealed an environmental migration classification of voluntary and involuntary migration: Those that were forced to move due to climate change, and those who saw opportunity because their current situation was being eroded due to climate change. Relating these breakdowns to those defined by Lu et al., emergency and forced migrants would be considered involuntary, as those people have no choice but to leave and seek other sources of employment and livelihood.[10]  Motivated migrants would be voluntary migrants, as they saw the opportunity to leave their home because of unfavorable environmental conditions. This differentiation is important as voluntary migrants are generally less impacted in terms of human development, while involuntary migrants are usually more impacted.  A review of the literature reveals that researchers have overlapping or heterogeneous classifications with nuanced definitions of migration types and motivations for migration.  An adaption of a universal or widely accepted classification of environmentally sourced migration is a research gap that should be noted and applied to future studies. A shared classification would enable researchers to better detect and address the impacts of environmental motivated migration, including climate change, on human development.



### Human Development Process - Relation to Human Development

​	The main issue of human development, as described by Amartya Sen, is the process of expanding the real freedoms that people utilize. These freedoms take five forms: political freedoms, economic freedoms, social freedoms, transparency guarantees, and protective securities. Economic freedom is the principal concern relating to climate change effects on migration as migration is tied to the ability to be part of a labor force. Importantly, there are differing impacts based on whether the migration is voluntary or involuntary.  Generally, voluntary migrants are able to preserve their ability to continue to be included in the labor force.   Involuntary migrants that are forced to move due to climate issues are more likely to be out of work, a key part of human development. 

​	While this issue of climate change and its effects on migration is applicable worldwide, Africa uniquely possesses multiple attributes that make it appropriate to evaluate. Africa includes a majority of countries with a large amount of their population reliant on agriculture.[1] In Africa, “the marginal agricultural and pastoral systems” found in the Sahel are already under severe threat from “desertification, drought, overgrazing, and overpopulation,” which will lead to increased migration.[5]  

​	Another reason why Africa is a logical place to study is the already established effects of climate change on African populations in regards to migration, and the inability for various African countries to provide solutions. Populations in the Sahel, West, and Equatorial Africa that are more likely to suffer climatic challenges are also more at risk due to “low levels of state and social adaptive capacity.”[5]  Unfreedoms present with this scenario, such as a lack of social care and absence of government solutions, compounded with the effect of climate change, lead to a decrease in human development as populations are forced to migrate. According to Mastrorillo et al., least developed countries found in Africa lack capital to invest in innovative and  technological solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation, leaving their populations that work the agricultural sector vulnerable to adverse effects in income and employment.[6]  This affects the freedom of “protective securities” and “economic facilities” that Sen says are crucial to providing choice and opportunities that contribute to human development. Without proper safety nets in place by governments such as crop insurance, people are forced to resort to migration to solve domestic economic issues.[9]  The act of migration itself decreases development, as families are forced to uproot themselves from a community, altering their social opportunities. 

​	Research by Mcleman et and Hunter seeks to quantify the vulnerability and adaptation to climate change described previously, and focuses on the West African Sahel region. According to, the choices made by humans relating to climate change and migrations are “situated within the context of human vulnerability to climate change.”[7]  They define vulnerability as a function of exposure to the impacts of climate change, as well as the ability for communities to adapt, and the sensitivity of communities to climate change, or “the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes”.  Voluntary migration is one form of adaptation that households make when threatened with changing environmental conditions in sensitive systems.  Consistent with other literature, Mcleman and Hunter state that agricultural and natural resource dependent communities are more sensitive to climate change related effects, increasing the vulnerability of the system. 



### Human Development Process - Statistical description about migration volumes and patterns

  When migration occurs as a result of climate factors, common migratory patterns are often followed. North Africa is often a source of migrants and a transit region for migrants seeking entrance into Europe, however, climate change is rendering North Africa less attractive as a final destination.[5] Due to stronger climate impacts in the Sahel and Sub-Saharan Africa, they will become drivers behind the Arican migratory pattern that trends northwards to Europe.[5]  While there is not data on migratory patterns of environmental refugees specifically, there are patterns generally followed by migrants in Africa. For migrants with attempts to relocate completely, there is a western migration route which ends in Spain, and there is a central migration route ending in Italy.[1]  Other times, migrants often practice circular migration, in which they move to a new place to escape climatic effects, and then move back to their original location.[7] In South Africa, it was identified that black or low income South Africans are more influenced by climatic variables, and more likely to migrate than white and or high income people.[6]  There are various regional specific migratory patterns, which all have vary impacts on human development and the migratory population.



### Human Development Process - Analysis

  Complex adaptive systems are, as defined by Owen Barder, are circumstances where the economy and society consist of various interactions between evolving adaptive agents that ebb and flow together. Migration in relation to climate change is a prime example of a complex adaptive system, as migration is dependent on the economy, which is often influenced by climate change, and migration has impacts on society and the economy, showing the interconnectedness of this issue. There are various features of complex adaptive systems, all of which are satisfied by this issue.  The most applicable ones are the idea that complex adaptive systems are impossible to predict in detail, yet broad predictions can be made about systems as a whole.  In modeling the relationship between climate change and migration, researchers can not predict individual movements due to climate change, but by observing the strength of various variables, broad generalizations can be made about the use of migration as a reaction to climate change. Lastly, the relationship between migration and climate change does not tend towards equilibrium, as migration is constantly being influenced by numerous variables pertaining to climate change.  The scale of the problem is also important, as the effects of climate change on migration are studied at individual levels such as different countries or regions within the country. 

​	To determine effects on a global scale, an approach similar to Nieves et al. could be used. Nieves et al. determined population density, then studied the covariates to determine which factors were most important in determining population distribution. A similar method could be used, in which the effects of climate change on migration are observed in a country, and then the covariates importance could be determined. From that, the scale of the issue being examined could be increased, as the importance of the covariates could be applied to a global level, enabling researchers to broadly determine the effect on migration by examining different variables. The issue of migration as related to climate change is an ever evolving complex system, and has the possibility to be studied at a larger scale.



### Geospatial Data Science Methods

  The geospatial datasets used are discretized into two methods: classical statistical and machine learning methods. The classical methods used incorporate data science methods by combining census with geospatial data, and often use GIS systems to visualize the data. One example of this is in, in which the influence of climate variability on internal migration flows is studied in South Africa.[6]  Census data from 1996, 2001, and 2011 containing information about demographics, general health and fertility, education and employment, mortality, housing, households and services, and migration was used in conjunction with climate data. Climate data was taken from the African Drought and Flood monitor project, which monitors the hydrologic conditions of land surfaces in Africa, providing data on climatic indicators like precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture. 

​	The determinants of inter-district migration flows were calculated using a gravity model. The Poisson Pseudo Maximum-Likelihood gravity model estimator was used. Their findings showed that migration flows increased with larger positive maximum temperature anomalies and negative precipitation anomalies, and decreased with lower soil moisture at the origin. The results showed that climatic temperature changes are more important in determining migration than precipitation effects, and that the effect of climate on migration flows in South Africa is statistically significant and relevant in terms of magnitude. The researchers then disaggregated migration flows by variables such as age, gender, marital status, ethinic group, and income, finding that the strongest climate impact is in ages 15-30, and that there is a stronger effect on black and low income migrants. Lastly, they asked whether the effect of climate on migration flows varies depending on the importance of agriculture in the district.  A causal link between climate, agriculture, and migration exists, as people that originate from more agriculturally-oriented districts tend to migrate more.

  Another study using classical data science methods is “An Analysis of Large-Scale Forced Migration in Africa.”[1]  An ordered logistic regression analysis was used on 48 African countries.  The spatial parameters includes all continental African countries, and the dependent variable is large-scale forced migration, coded onto a three point scale. The basic assumption, which the research is based on, is that “large-scale forced migration (LSFM) is a product of severe human insecurity in countries of origin.”  The independent variable they studied was climate risk.  To properly capture the diversity in climate effects and outcomes across Africa, all continental African countries were used to analyze the situation in different regions as a “function of its climatic effects.” They used Busby et al.’s classification of physical exposure to climate related hazards.  Busby et al. used historic data to map physical exposure as an outcome of climatic conditions, and took into account population density and other factors.  Based on Busby et al.’s study, African countries were separated into three categories of risk.  The study also used five control variables: “violence, political regime, life expectancy at birth (as a proxy for public health), income per capita and official development assistance.” The findings showed that climate risk has an indirect effect on large scale forced migration, and within short time periods it is difficult to differentiate its cumulative effect from violent conflicts.  This is partly due to time-lags, as a violent conflict may lead to large scale forced migration quickly, while effects of climate change may accumulate over several years before large scale migration is observed.

​	A Bayesian belief network (BBN) machine learning method was incorporated by Drees and Liehr to analyze social-ecological conditions for migration in the Sahel.[4] BBN works by establishing a prior probability of an event A. After recent information about event A is gathered, the probability of event A is updated resulting in the posterior probability of event A, which provides the quantitative component of the BBN. The second component is qualitative, which is represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) “that represents the dependencies between the variables (nodes) with arrows pointing from given conditions (parent node) to likely effects (child node).” To determine the motives for migration, the researchers aggregated different answers for survey questions concerning reasons for migration that relate to comparable motivations.  The four motives were education, familial, sustenance/employment, and visit/curiosity.  Through combining the motives, room was left “For multi-faceted decision making patterns” not covered by a single theoretical approach. 

​	The BBN is trained by using the expectation maximization algorithm, which is able to interpret incomplete data. The BBN of each submodel is trained with the complete dataset, and the sensitivity of the child node to findings at the parent node is computed, and the least influential node is excluded. The data used is socio-empirical survey data of 905 interviewees, 460 in Senegal, and 445 in Mali.  The data for environmental conditions was formed by different datasets on precipitation and land cover, provided by the Research Group of Climatology from the University of Bayreuth. The BBN was then used to estimate altering future developments in different scenarios.  Two dimensions, “politics and economy” and “climate” frame the scenarios, and form two scenario axes.  The axis “politics and economy” describes political stability of institutions and economic development, and the “climate” axis describes low versus severe regional impact of climate change. 

​	The results from analysis using a BBN show that economic motives are the most important driver for migration. In this study, there was a lower impact of environmental variables than socio-economic conditions, because environmental nodes are only parent nodes to one migration motive, while socio-economic nodes are parents to all four motives. While environmental and climatic conditions had a smaller influence compared to socio-economic conditions, future changes in climate change will likely shift migration patterns.  In conclusion, while a BBN was able to analyze different scenarios, the importance of climate change was downplayed because of the categorization of nodes. Even with this downside, BBNs are capable of analyzing the “statistical interdependencies of socio-economic and environmental factors” in relation to their influence on migration.[4]   BBNs are also more effective than classical statistical methods, as they are able to estimate future patterns of migration from scenarios that assume changes in social-ecological conditions. Another strength is the ability of a BBN to use incomplete data, or data from different sources with differing scales and units, allowing for a larger amount of data to be studied, increasing the model’s performance.  While BBNs have some drawbacks, they should be utilized more often, as their benefits allow for examination of causality, and they can process large amounts of data.



### Discussion

  Thus far, my progress has led me to first, identify different types of migration and how they affect populations differently, and how migration is related to human development. Through the use of classical statistical models and machine learning models, like Bayesian belief networks, relationships between climate change and human migration were identified in Africa. These techniques were able to determine specific impacts on different groups of people, and determined differences in effects when presented with different types of climate change.  Even so, research gaps exist. One such gap is that there have been no studies on the population of people who would benefit from migration, but do not have the means to do so.  This would include populations that would normally participate in voluntary migration, but are unable to because of external factors. These people, or “intransient populations” occur when people do not have the resources to adapt to a sudden or gradual climatic disaster, and lack the choice to adapt to climatic change via migration.  Because of the importance of populations unable to migrate, and the effects of human development of this scenario, they will be the focus of the proposed research question. My proposed research question is whether the type of migration pattern used by a specific region is an indicator of the number of intransient people unable to migrate. Potentially, the BBN framework used by Drees and Liehr could be adapted to include people who have not migrated to link similarities and differences in transient and intransient populations.
